# SimplifyMe (Chrome extension for people with visual disability)
## Inspiration
People with visual disability or impairments find it difficult to read text on web pages due to the small size of font. Since the hackathon's theme revolved around diversity, inclusivity and accessibility, I wanted to leverage this opportunity to make web more accessible for people with visual imparity or disability

## What it does
My solution is a chrome extension that enables users to make web more accessible. It works on all web pages and havs the following features:
- Enable zoom capabilities making it easy for the people zoom in and read text
- Enable word spacing capabilities i.e users can adjust spacing between words
- Enable character spacing capabilities i.e uses can adjust spacing between each character
- Text to speech capability i.e. User can hear the sentences they have chosen to listen.

## How I built it
By leveraging chromeâ€™s inbuilt API to access data on webpage.

Use the access on webpage to perform actions like getting text from user and using text-to-speech API to hear the selected text.

Use the access on webpage to perform action on the css of the webpage i.e zoom level, character spacing and word spacing


## Challenges I ran into
Understanding the chrome API, what parameters it need and passing operations from and to the webpage from the extension itself.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Making the world a better place to live for everyone. This extension would help people with visual disability to access web more clearly.


## What I learned
- Developing chrome extension
- Understand chrome inbuild API

## What's next for SimplifyMe (Chrome Extension for Web Accessibility)
More features and integration of APIs making it more easy for users with visual disability to navigate and make web more accessible for them
